I didn't actually write any code, but instead opted for a mathmatical
solution. 

The key is determining that these values must be divisible by the
product of all the primes in the given range.  For example, the 1..10
example is divisible 12 times by 210.

Finding the 1..20 prime product, I multiplied that by 12 - found that
all the numbers 1..20 are divisible except for 16, which yields a .5
remainder.  Multiplying this number further by two, resulted in the
minimum number divisible by all of the numbers 1..20
